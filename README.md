# Java-Practise-Codes

Here I will be posting all the coding problems that I have solved till date. 
I will update it every day. I hope someday this will help you in your coding journey.

Few heads up:

Always give a few tries on a problem before looking at the solution. Trust me the feeling of success hits different when you solve a question on your own.

Format:

1. Question
2. Approach that I have used. 
3. Code along with comments.
4. Algorithms are descriptive, self explanatory and you can find them in the code itself.
